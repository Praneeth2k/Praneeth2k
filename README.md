### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Here you can find some of the projects that I have done during my three years of enginnering in Computer Science at BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore.

I am mostly interested in web development. I've learnt and used React, NodeJS, MongoDB..all the good stuff.

I have also done a special project with Samsung which involves ML, NL training and API calls. Please do check it out [here](https://github.com/Praneeth2k/Bixby-Zomato-capsule-Samsung).

I am currently working on a website which helps colleges and schools make timetables. Check out - www.makemytimetable.com.
